Scrum is a methodology of planning and communication techniques that emphasize collaboration between developers, the business, the stakeholder and its customers. It involves iterative development, product and sprint backlogs, user stories, daily meetings, follow-up, evaluation and adjustment.
One of the techniques we use is XP. Which is an adaptive software engineering methodology that is focused around a core of best practices: incremental design, test-driven development, pair programming, collective code ownership, continuous integration and continuous deployment.
